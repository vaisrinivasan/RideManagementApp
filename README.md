# RideManagementApp

You are part of a team, building a ride management application like Uber. You are responsible
for the driver onboarding module. As part of this module you are required to build an
interface that will allow a driver to sign-up as a driver partner. The driver onboarding module
should:

a) Allow a driver to enter their profile information

b) Trigger onboarding processes like document collection, background verification
(Third Party), shipping of tracking device (Third Party), etc.

Please create a list of the API interfaces you will expose to support these requirements and
also come up with choices of data stores, tech stacks, etc.
